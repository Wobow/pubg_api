# Nodejs Wrapper for the official PUBG API
[![npm 0.0.5](https://img.shields.io/badge/npm-v0.0.5-brightgreen.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pubg-api)
## Intro
This is a universal wrapper/client for the official [PlayerUnknown's BattleGround's API](https://developer.playbattlegrounds.com/) that runs on Node JS and the browser.

Project owner is [Wobow](https://github.com/Wobow), and is open to contribution.

It includes helpers to do the following :

**Matches**
- Load and filter matches
- Load a specific match
- Find players match history
- Load Telemetry Files

**General API**
- Handle API Rate limits

## Installation

    $ npm install pubg-api@latest -S

## Usage

### Importation
After installation, you can import the module to your project using require. 
```javascript
const Pubgapi = require('pubg-api');

const apiInstance = new Pubgapi('<apiKey>');
```
The module exposes a class that represents an instance of the api, given an [official API key](https://developer.playbattlegrounds.com/) that you must provide.


### Making Calls
You can then interract with the instance of the API. All routes use promises by default. 

For example :
```javascript
apiInstance
    .loadSamples(options)
    .then(samples => {
        // success
        // Returns JSON object (see PUBG Developer Docs)
        // ex: attaining a match id from the sample set
        return loadMatchById(samples.relationships.matches.data[0]);
    }, err => {
        // handle error
    });
```

### Customization
By providing an optional second parameter on creation of the API instance you can override a number of default settings. This parameter is an object with the following keys:
- `asyncType`  whether to return Promises or Observables [default promise]
- `defaultShard` The server shard to query [default pc-na]
- `deferRequests` Whether to enable rate limiting, by deferring api requests until your limit allows for another API call [default true]
- `tokenRate` The custom rate limit for your app in requests per minute (see your developer account) [default 10]

More details on each of these customization options below:

**Observables**
You can force the wrapper to return [rxjs' Observables](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs) only by specifying with the asyncType options:
```javascript
const apiInstance = new PubgApi('<apiKey>', {asyncType: 'observable'});
```
or (after instance creation)
```javascript
apiInstance.asyncType = 'observable';
```
then
```javascript
apiInstance
    .loadMatches(options) // <-- Now returns an Observable
    .subscribe(matches => {
        // success
    }, err => {
        // handle error
    });
```

**Shard**
You can specify the default shard by using the optional parameter:
```javascript
const apiInstance = new PubgApi('<apiKey>', {defaultShard: 'selected-shard'});
```
or (after instance creation)
```javascript
apiInstance.defaultShard = 'selected-shard';
```

In addition, all player and matches routes have an optional second parameter where you can specify a shard to query for one individual api call

**Rate Limiting**
Rate limiting is enabled by default.
When enabled all API requests (matches, samples or players route) will return a promise (or observable) and store that promise inside of an internal queue. When the user is within their request limit it will resolve these promises on a First in First out basis at an interval defined by the tokenRate provided.
To override this functionality you can once again instantiate the API instance using the options parameters:
```javascript
const apiInstance = new PubgApi('<apiKey>', {deferRequests: false});
```
To enable or disable rate limiting after instantiation, use the setRateLimiting() function, this will ensure that all currently deferred requests are released (if disabling) or restarts the API rate loop (if enabling)
```javascript
apiInstance.setRateLimiting(enabled, tokenRate);
```

## Status

This tab highlight the status of each route and function attached to it.

| Route              | Function                     | Status           | Version     |
|-------             |----------                    |--------          |---------    |
| /matches           | `PubgApi.loadMatches`        | Deprecated       | ^0.0.1      |
| /matches/{id}      | `PubgApi.loadMatchById`      | Up to date       | ^0.0.1      |
| /players/          | `PubgApi.searchPlayers`      | Up to date       | ^1.0.0      |
| /players/{id}      | `PubgApi.loadPlayerById`     | Up to date       | ^1.0.0      |
| telemetry          | `PubgApi.loadTelemetry`      | Up to date       | ^0.6.0      |
| /status            | `PubgApi.healthStatus`       | Up to date       | ^0.0.1      |

## Contributing

If you want to contribute, open a pull request. Unless the change you are requesting is a hotfix for the latest stable version, you should always pull from `develop`. 

### Branch organisation
`master` is the branch where we try to have the latest stable version up to date. Every new version shall be tagged properly with its version, followed by a release. One cannot push to this branch without a code review from the code owners. Use develop instead.

`develop` is the branch used to iterate the development versions of the wrapper. It should always be based on `master`. All unstable versions of the wrapper will be tested on this branch. 

### Versioning

We will follow the naming convention of `major`.`minor`.`build`. 

### Lint

We are using `eslint` to check the code syntax, and are using the [AirBnB style guide for Javascript](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). 
To run the lint :

    $ npm run lint

Be sure to clean your code before submitting it.

### Building

To build the wrapper, run 

    $ npm run build

It will generate the file `lib/pubg-api.js` using babel.

### Publishing

Run

    $ npm publish

It will automatically check lint, unit tests and build the lib properly before publishing. The version must be bumped manually.

## Tests

You can run the unit tests executing npm test. To execute the tests, you must provide an environnment variable `PUBG_API_KEY_TEST` set with the api key you want to use to run the tests. 

    $ export PUBG_API_KEY_TEST=<your API key>
    $ npm test

## Roadmap & Guidelines

The goal of this wrapper is to simplify access to the API, and give a broader spectrum of functions to help developers use the API to its full potential.

This includes developping functions that computes multiple API calls and responses.

- [x] Implement [Telemetry](https://developer.playbattlegrounds.com/docs/en/telemetry.html) 
- [x] Implement [rxjs observable](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs) alternative to promise
- [x] Implement rate limiting
- [x] Allow selecting a specific shard for each call, instead of setting a default shard
- [x] Wrap multiple shard functions
- [ ] Helper functions to quickly ascertain match data (winning roster, etc.)
